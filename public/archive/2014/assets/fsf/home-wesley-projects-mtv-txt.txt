I've worked at MTV between 2010 and 2012. It was fucking amazing.

I've met spectacular people, messed around with much more than I was expecting to, and got beaten up from the total lack of process. But it was by far my craziest job, the ones that "I'd do it all over again."

I've done most of their Drupal admin modules, a fucking video encoder, integrated Twitter with TV content generation, integrated the advertisement system with the financial system, learned to talk to every possible department, worked with third parties, freelancers, companies, had fun, saw two VMB awards, drank a lot of beer, fell miserably in the company party, anyway, it was fun.

But the boss left, and his replacement made the whole team flee. Not to say the original MTV Brasil closed. :(
