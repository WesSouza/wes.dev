I've worked for Univision between 2012 and 2013. It was an awesome experience.

Actually I've worked for Tech Mahindra, a consulting company from India with an office in Brazil, and a nearshoring contract with Univision.

I've learned a lot about processes, organization, Scrum, and all those things big companies do. I spoke a lot of English, participated in a huge video project, and proposed a big JavaScript restructuring that was implemented in the whole portal, after I left.

Also spent one month working in New York, invited by them.
