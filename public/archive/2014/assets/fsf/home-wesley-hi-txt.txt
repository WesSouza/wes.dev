Hey there, what's up?

I'm Wex. Developer, TV series watcher, beer & coffee drinker. I have played - and worked - with several technologies that you can see below this terminal.

I'm always available for a cup of ( coffee || beer ) and discuss ideas, opportunities and the well known etcetera.

Moreover, have fun here.
